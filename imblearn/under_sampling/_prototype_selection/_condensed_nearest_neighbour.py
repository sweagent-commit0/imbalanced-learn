    Parameters
    ----------
    {sampling_strategy}

    {random_state}

    n_neighbors : int or estimator object, default=None
        If ``int``, size of the neighbourhood to consider to compute the
        nearest neighbors. If object, an estimator that inherits from
        :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.base.KNeighborsMixin` that will be used to
        find the nearest-neighbors.  If `None`, a
        :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier` with a 1-NN rules will
        be used.

    n_seeds_S : int, default=1
        Number of samples to extract in order to build the set S.

    {n_jobs}

    Attributes
    ----------
    sampling_strategy_ : dict
        Dictionary containing the information to sample the dataset. The keys
        corresponds to the class labels from which to sample and the values
        are the number of samples to sample.

    estimator_ : estimator object
        The validated K-nearest neighbor estimator created from `n_neighbors` parameter.

        .. deprecated:: 0.12
           `estimator_` is deprecated in 0.12 and will be removed in 0.14. Use
           `estimators_` instead that contains the list of all K-nearest
           neighbors estimator used for each pair of class.

    estimators_ : list of estimator objects of shape (n_resampled_classes - 1,)
        Contains the K-nearest neighbor estimator used for per of classes.

        .. versionadded:: 0.12

    sample_indices_ : ndarray of shape (n_new_samples,)
        Indices of the samples selected.

        .. versionadded:: 0.4

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features in the input dataset.

        .. versionadded:: 0.9

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during `fit`. Defined only when `X` has feature
        names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 0.10

    Notes
    -----
    The method is based on [1]_.

    Supports multi-class resampling: a strategy one (minority) vs. each other
    classes is applied.
