    """Oversample using Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) algorithm.

    This method is similar to SMOTE but it generates different number of
    samples depending on an estimate of the local distribution of the class
    to be oversampled.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <smote_adasyn>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    {sampling_strategy}

    {random_state}

    n_neighbors : int or estimator object, default=5
        The nearest neighbors used to define the neighborhood of samples to use
        to generate the synthetic samples. You can pass:

        - an `int` corresponding to the number of neighbors to use. A
          `~sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` instance will be fitted in this
          case.
        - an instance of a compatible nearest neighbors algorithm that should
          implement both methods `kneighbors` and `kneighbors_graph`. For
          instance, it could correspond to a
          :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` but could be extended to
          any compatible class.

    {n_jobs}

        .. deprecated:: 0.10
           `n_jobs` has been deprecated in 0.10 and will be removed in 0.12.
           It was previously used to set `n_jobs` of nearest neighbors
           algorithm. From now on, you can pass an estimator where `n_jobs` is
           already set instead.

    Attributes
    ----------
    sampling_strategy_ : dict
        Dictionary containing the information to sample the dataset. The keys
        corresponds to the class labels from which to sample and the values
        are the number of samples to sample.

    nn_ : estimator object
        Validated K-nearest Neighbours estimator linked to the parameter `n_neighbors`.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features in the input dataset.

        .. versionadded:: 0.9

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during `fit`. Defined only when `X` has feature
        names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 0.10

        features only.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is based on [1]_.

    Supports multi-class resampling. A one-vs.-rest scheme is used.
