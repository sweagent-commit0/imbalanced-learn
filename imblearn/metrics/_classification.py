    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : array-like, default=None
        The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their
        order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a
        majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will
        result in 0 components in a macro average. For multilabel targets,
        labels are column indices. By default, all labels in ``y_true`` and
        ``y_pred`` are used in sorted order.

    pos_label : str, int or None, default=1
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If ``pos_label is None`` and in binary classification, this function
        returns the average sensitivity and specificity if ``average``
        is one of ``'weighted'``.
        If the data are multiclass, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report
        scores for that label only.

    average : str, default=None
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    warn_for : tuple or set of {{"sensitivity", "specificity"}}, for internal use
        This determines which warnings will be made in the case that this
        function is being used to return only one of its metrics.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    sensitivity : float (if `average is None`) or ndarray of             shape (n_unique_labels,)
        The sensitivity metric.

    specificity : float (if `average is None`) or ndarray of             shape (n_unique_labels,)
        The specificity metric.

    support : int (if `average is None`) or ndarray of             shape (n_unique_labels,)

    The geometric mean (G-mean) is the root of the product of class-wise
    sensitivity. This measure tries to maximize the accuracy on each of the

    G-mean is the squared root of the product of the sensitivity
    and specificity. For multi-class problems it is a higher root of the

    For compatibility with other imbalance performance measures, G-mean can be
    calculated for each class separately on a one-vs-rest basis when

    The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0. Traditionally if at least one

    Returns
    -------
    report : string / dict
        Text summary of the precision, recall, specificity, geometric mean,
        and index balanced accuracy.
        Dictionary returned if output_dict is True. Dictionary has the
        following structure::

            {'label 1': {'pre':0.5,
                         'rec':1.0,
                         ...

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    loss : float or ndarray of floats
        Macro-Averaged MAE output is non-negative floating point.
        The best value is 0.0.
