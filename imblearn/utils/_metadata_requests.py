Metadata Routing Utility

In order to better understand the components implemented in this file, one
needs to understand their relationship to one another.

The only relevant public API for end users are the ``set_{method}_request``,
e.g. ``estimator.set_fit_request(sample_weight=True)``. However, third-party
developers and users who implement custom meta-estimators, need to deal with
the objects implemented in this file.

All estimators (should) implement a ``get_metadata_routing`` method, returning
the routing requests set for the estimator. This method is automatically
implemented via ``BaseEstimator`` for all simple estimators, but needs a custom
implementation for meta-estimators.

In non-routing consumers, i.e. the simplest case, e.g. ``SVM``,
``get_metadata_routing`` returns a ``MetadataRequest`` object.

In routers, e.g. meta-estimators and a multi metric scorer,
``get_metadata_routing`` returns a ``MetadataRouter`` object.

An object which is both a router and a consumer, e.g. a meta-estimator which
consumes ``sample_weight`` and routes ``sample_weight`` to its sub-estimators,
routing information includes both information about the object itself (added
via ``MetadataRouter.add_self_request``), as well as the routing information
for its sub-estimators.

A ``MetadataRequest`` instance includes one ``MethodMetadataRequest`` per
method in ``METHODS``, which includes ``fit``, ``score``, etc.

Request values are added to the routing mechanism by adding them to
``MethodMetadataRequest`` instances, e.g.
``metadatarequest.fit.add(param="sample_weight", alias="my_weights")``. This is
used in ``set_{method}_request`` which are automatically generated, so users
and developers almost never need to directly call methods on a
``MethodMetadataRequest``.

The ``alias`` above in the ``add`` method has to be either a string (an alias),
or a {True (requested), False (unrequested), None (error if passed)}``. There
are some other special values such as ``UNUSED`` and ``WARN`` which are used
for purposes such as warning of removing a metadata in a child class, but not
used by the end users.

``MetadataRouter`` includes information about sub-objects' routing and how
methods are mapped together. For instance, the information about which methods
of a sub-estimator are called in which methods of the meta-estimator are all
stored here. Conceptually, this information looks like:

```
{
    "sub_estimator1": (
        mapping=[(caller="fit", callee="transform"), ...],
        router=MetadataRequest(...),  # or another MetadataRouter
    ),
    ...
}
```

To give the above representation some structure, we use the following objects:

- ``(caller, callee)`` is a namedtuple called ``MethodPair``

- The list of ``MethodPair`` stored in the ``mapping`` field is a
  ``MethodMapping`` object

- ``(mapping=..., router=...)`` is a namedtuple called ``RouterMappingPair``

The ``set_{method}_request`` methods are dynamically generated for estimators
which inherit from the ``BaseEstimator``. This is done by attaching instances
of the ``RequestMethod`` descriptor to classes, which is done in the
``_MetadataRequester`` class, and ``BaseEstimator`` inherits from this mixin.
This mixin also implements the ``get_metadata_routing``, which meta-estimators
need to override, but it works for simple consumers as is.
